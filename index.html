    <h3>(It really has!) </h3>
    <p>App Academy has taught me alot of different things - some of which I <em>thought</em> I knew, but I was able to grasp the content so much better because of it. Some ideas that I became more fluent in were:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Polya's Problem Solving Framework</li>
            <ol><li>Understand the problem</li>
            <li>Come up with a plan</li>
            <li>Carry out the plan</li>
            <li>Go back and improve your solution</li>
        </ol>
        <li>JavaScript Function</li>
        <li>JavaScript Loops</li>
        <li>Git / GitHub</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Namely, being able to connect my GitHub account to my local PC, so that I can create a file (kinda like this one) and then send the changes to GitHub with: git add, git commit -m "add the commit message" and finally push the changes to the proper branch. Since I am working by myself, am pushing to the Master branch using "git push origin master" and BOOM! </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Another thing I learned, was it is better to NOT use the "br" tag to create spaces between paragraphs. Rather, you should create separate "p" tags, and then use CSS to create a padding / margin between the 2 paragraphs.</p>
